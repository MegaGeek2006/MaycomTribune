                            <td><p>25 year old Tom Robinson has been arrested for the rape of Mayella Ewell and Atticus Finch fails to defend him. 
                                This court case shook the town and brought in many people from all over Maycomb county just to see the final verdict of black vs white. 
                                The story of the Ewells goes as follows, every morning Mr. Finch would walk by the Ewells place on his way to work, 
                                Mayella would invite him in occasionally to work on the house and to help her around the house but one day when she was all alone he upped and raped her, 
                                she was screaming and fighting and her father Robert Ewell heard it, he ran up and saw Tom Robinson “runting on her”, 
                                he then scared him off and protected his injured daughter. Tom Robinson's story says he was passing by like everyday and she invited him in to fix a wardrobe, 
                                he noticed there were no children and Mayella said that they went to get ice cream then she upped and kissed him but he tried to resist, 
                                when Robert Ewell showed up he ran away because he was afraid to get killed.
                                The jury found him guilty and he was sent away to prison, while in prison Mr. Robinson attempted to escape and was shot dead to the ground.</p></td>
